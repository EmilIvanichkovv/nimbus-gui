                There are several ways to install Geth, including via a package manager, downloading
                a pre-built bundle, running as a docker container or building from downloaded source
                code. On this page the various installation options are explained for several major
                operating systems. Users prioritizing ease of installation should choose to use a
                package manager or prebuilt bundle. Users prioritizing customization should build
                from source. It is important to run the latest version of Geth because each release
                includes bugfixes and improvements over the previous versions. The stable releases
                are recommended for most users because they have been fully tested. A list of stable
                releases can be found here. Instructions for updating existing Geth installations
                are also provided in each section.
